        Title: üëãüèº Hi there,
        subtitle: "**welcome to my homepage...**"
        Content: |
          I am an **astrophysicist** specializing in the study of Very High 
          Energy (VHE) emissions from Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs). I try to
          explain black hole physics phenomenologically through causal inference,
          time-series analysis, machine learning, stochastic calculus, and a 
          myriad of other data science techniques using the data collected from 
          numerous telescopes worldwide. I have also contributed to the software 
          development of three different telescopes worldwide. My passion lies 
          in working with large datasets and using statistics to make sense of 
          them.

          I completed my PhD at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research 
          (TIFR), Mumbai and currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Scientist 
          at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), developing the array 
          control software and performing Monte-Carlo simulations for Cherenkov 
          Telescope Array (CTA). I also work on some interesting deep-learning 
          projects on the side. 
          
          Let's explore the cosmos using data and statistics...
