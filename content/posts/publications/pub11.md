# Abstract:
A prototype 64-pixel camera for a 4 m class Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope is in its final stage of development. The camera is based on 4 \(\times \) 4 array of SiPMs as a pixel sensor and would be mounted on the focal plane of the telescope. Eventually, the camera would be expanded to 256 pixels. The front-end electronics of the camera has an array of pixel sensors, bias supply to provide operating voltage to the sensors, preamplifiers to boost signal-to-noise ratio of the pixel signals, and low voltage dc supplies to power the preamplifiers. Stringent design goals and constraints have led to a customized design of the front-end electronics. The paper describes the design features of the front-end electronics along with its performance evaluation.
