# Abstract:
Due to the limited field of view (FoV) of Cherenkov telescopes, the time needed to achievetarget sensitivity for surveys of the extragalactic and Galactic sky is large. To optimize the timespent to perform such surveys, a so-called “divergent mode” of the Cherenkov Telescope ArrayObservatory (CTAO) was proposed as an alternative observation strategy to the traditional parallel pointing. In the divergent mode, each telescope points to a position in the sky that is slightly offset, in the outward direction, from the original center of the field of view. This bring the advantage of increasing the total instantaneous arrays’ FoV. From an enlarged field of view also benefits the search for very-high-energy transient sources, making it possible to cover large sky regions in follow-up observations, or to quickly cover the probability sky map in case of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB), Gravitational Waves (GW), and other transient events. In this contribution, we present the proposed implementation of the diverge.
