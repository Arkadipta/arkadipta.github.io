Most of my research so far have been towards understanding the physics of [Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus) by studying the most energetic emission from them. AGN are [Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) at the heart of distant galaxies. AGN typically have a mass 10--100 million times that of the sun.
